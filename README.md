# Pong-1972
# Start Date: May 27 2025

This project is mostly a challenge for myself to learn how to use the low level game library SDL as well as Networking

# My Goals
1. Learn SDL
2. Sharpen my C++ skills
3. Implement an Online or Lan Capability in order to learn more about Networking

# Updates

1. #### Currently I am learning more about network programming as I do not want to use the SDL_net library since that would do most of the heavy lifting for me
